For most mainstream hosting companies running a CGI-Webinterface

Steps:
Create a php.ini file with the following:
magic_quotes_gpc = Off
extension=pdo.so
extension=pdo_mysql.so
Put it in your Joomla 3 root. Then change the htaccess.txt in your Joomla 3 root to .htaccess. Add the following lines to the .htaccess file (at the top) :
<IfModule mod_suphp.c>
  suPHP_ConfigPath /home/myusername/public_html/yourJ3folder
  <Files php.ini>
    order allow,deny
    deny from all
  </Files>
</IfModule>
Change "myusername" and "yourJ3folder" to your respective folders. The "/home/myusername/public_html/yourJ3folder" can be found via the Global Configuration:
In Joomla backend > System > System Information > [Directory Permissions], the folder is usually the same as the log directory (but without /logs at the end).
.htaccess for some hosts

For some hosts, add "php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off" to the .htaccess file
