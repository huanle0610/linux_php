If You want that MySQL listen only to localhost edit the MySQL configuration file and write

bind-address=127.0.0.1
Configuration file can be /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf
Next, you will need to restart the database server:

$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart


如果你只需要本地socket连接mysql
# Don't listen on a TCP/IP port at all. This can be a security enhancement,
# if all processes that need to connect to mysqld run on the same host.
# All interaction with mysqld must be made via Unix sockets or named pipes.
# Note that using this option without enabling named pipes on Windows
# (via the "enable-named-pipe" option) will render mysqld useless!
# 
#skip-networking
